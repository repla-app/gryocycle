Gyrocycle is a Jekyll theme. It uses [Raster](https://github.com/robenkleene/raster) to construct a layout using typographic grid.

The typefaces are [Rubik][rubik] for headers, [Fira Sans][firasans] for body copy, [Open Sans][opensans] for block quotes, and [Fira Mono][firamono] for code. All of them are free software under the [SIL Open Font License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIL_Open_Font_License) or [Apache License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). Thank you for everyone's hard work on free typography.
